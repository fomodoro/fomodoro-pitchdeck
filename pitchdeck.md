# Governance introduction

**What is Governance?**
- In simple terms, “Governance” is a structure that every user or participant agrees to follow. 

**What is Blockchain Governance?**
- Blockchain is a decentralized network with lots of moving parts and features. The mechanism of how blockchain can adapt and stay relevant to changing times and requirements is called blockchain governance. 

---

# Governance introduction

**Why is it so important?**
- According to many experts, the ability of a blockchain network to evolve and upgrade amidst ongoing development is a key differentiator to stay current and competitive.

# Governance introduction

**Elements of Blockchain Governance**
- Consensus
- Incentives
- Information
- Governing Structure

# Governance introduction

**Blockchain Governance Strategies**
- **Off-Chain**: Usually promotes a balance between a blockchain community, e.g. its core developers, miners, users, and business organizations. 
- **On-Chain**: This is the latest entry in the blockchain governance structures and explicitly created for blockchain. The direct democracy in On-Chain governance increase the user needs by giving them more control and power of decision-making.

# Fomodoro

Fomodoro is an ON-CHAIN gasless multi-governance client.

---

# Why?

Seeing that governance is a great way for the project shows respect to token holders, by giving them the power to make decision on the project's next step or even road map. With on-chain governance, all the votes will be published on Binance Smart Chain.

---

# How?

**For project development team**
- Create your own project space 
- Personalize voting power calculation
- Create new proposal 

**For project users**
- Vote, making decision on your favorite project (rather than just holding its token)

*And many features coming soon...*
