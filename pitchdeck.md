# Governance introduction

**Blockchain Governance Strategies**
- **Off-Chain**: Usually promotes a balance between a blockchain community, e.g. its core developers, miners, users, and business organizations. 
- **On-Chain**: This is the latest entry in the blockchain governance structures and explicitly created for blockchain. The direct democracy in On-Chain governance increase the user needs by giving them more control and power of decision-making.

# Fomodoro

Fomodoro is an partly on-chain gasless multi-governance client, where blockchain project can create proposal without any fee.

---

# Why?

Seeing that governance is a great way for the project to show respectation to token holders, by giving them the power to make decision on the project's next step or even road map. With on-chain governance, all the votes will be transparent and published  on Binance Smart Chain.

---

# How?

**For project development team**
- Create your own project space 
- Personalize voting power calculation
- Create new proposal 

**For project users**
- Vote, making decision on your favorite project (rather than just holding its token)

*And many features coming soon...*
